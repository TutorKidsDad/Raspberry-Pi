## About

This repository is a collection of Raspberry Pi projects focusing on hardware interfacing. It provides ready-to-use scripts and code snippets to connect, control, and monitor various hardware components via Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, I2C, SPI, UART, and more.

---

## Features

- Examples for interfacing with popular sensors (e.g., DHT11, BMP180, etc.).
- Control actuators like relays, motors, and LEDs.
- Communication protocols like I2C, SPI, UART, and GPIO.
- Display interfacing (e.g., LCD, OLED, TFT).
- Modular and well-commented Python code for better understanding.
